### How to Prepare for This Course?

We created CoRise for professionals looking to acquire new skills. This
course is a “flipped classroom” model, and it moves quickly. To make the
most of your CoRise experience, we recommend three key tips:

#### **Look ahead before the week**

Tactically anticipate that CoRise will require a commitment of time and
energy. Block out 6-8 hours each week on your calendar during your
course.

Review the course materials and project before the week starts. The live
sessions are meant to complement the material and project; this is NOT
the type of course where you can show up to live sessions and learn
everything you need to complete the projects. Take at least an hour to
read the course material before the Monday lecture and review the
project before the project session.

#### **Ask questions when you are stuck**

We have a “no dumb questions” philosophy at CoRise. Reach out if you are
having an issue and ask a question in Slack! Others will benefit from
learning alongside you 😁.

#### **Do as much of the weekly project as possible and submit what you have**

We have designed this course to be at the intersection of challenge and
ability, which means some of the material will be difficult! Don’t worry
if you’re having trouble completing the weekly project. Just do as much
as you can, and submit what you have. We primarily care that you are
learning and building your skill set, not that your weekly project is
completely polished. When you submit your project, you can indicate
where you got stuck or where you need assistance, and your peer reviewer
will assist you.

Your experience going through course materials will depend on your
familiarity with the content and your learning style, but below is a
potential guide to help manage your time.

There are two core sessions we expect everyone to attend:

| Session                   | You will leave this session with:                                         |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Monday Lecture            | An understanding of the week’s content                                    |
| Wednesday Project Kickoff | The weekly project explained and the first part of the project completed. |

There are additional, non-mandatory, sessions to attend as needed:

Time Management

- **Monday**: 1-hour live lecture

- **Monday-Wednesday**: Go through the articles and coding exercises,
  completing as many as you can and asking any questions in Slack. You
  will likely need to allocate about an hour each day, or more if you’re
  new to programming.

- **Wednesday**: 1-hour project kickoff; start going through the project
  with course team and classmates.

- **Friday**: Office hours: Once a week, your TA will host a session for
  you to work on your weekly project with the support of peers and the
  TA if needed.

- **Sunday**: Project Walkthrough: Once a week, your TA will walk
  through the weekly project from start to finish to ensure you have
  what you need to succeed on the project.

- **Sunday Evening**: Submit your project

- **Monday Evening**: Complete your code/peer review. You can review
  other project submissions in the \#projects Slack channel for
  inspiration and learning.
