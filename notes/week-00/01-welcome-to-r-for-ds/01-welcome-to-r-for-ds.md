### 👋 Hi!!

Hello, I’m Ramnath, and I’m excited to lead this course.

Over the next 15 days, we are going to learn about the fundamentals of
doing data science with [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), using the
[tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org). We will work through the data-science
lifecycle, starting with **importing data** into R, **tidying** it,
**transforming** it to an analysis-ready format, and **visualizing** it.
As students, you will learn by doing, via hands-on, real-world projects.
You’ll be supported along the way by an amazing cohort of professional
peers and our incredible course team 🙌.

You are absolutely in the right place if any of these sound like you:

- Anyone with some programming knowledge interested in becoming a Data
  Analyst, Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer.
- Software Engineers skilled in programming looking for a career change
  into data science.
- Financial Analysts, Accountants, or other professionals looking to
  learn R for powerful analysis.



\[SIDEBAR\]

Our goals for this course are ambitious. By the end, we will be able to:

- Understand data science fundamentals, know how to get data, and read
  and modify this data using these packages.

- Complete a data analysis on real-world data (using tried-and-true best
  practices)

### 👉 Let me introduce myself

I’m Ramnath Vaidyanathan, and I’m excited to lead this course! Currently
I’m the Head of Data Science and Engineering at [Theta
CLV](https://thetaclv.com), where I lead a multi-disciplinary team of
data scientists and software engineers to revolutionize the world of
customer based corporate valuation.

In prior roles I’ve been Head of Machine Learning and Data Products at
[DataCamp](https://datacamp.com), Lead Data Scientist at
[Alteryx](https://alteryx.com), and Assistant Professor of Operations
Management at [McGill University](https://mcgill.com).

I am deeply addicted to data and R, and have developed several
open-source R packages, including `rCharts`, `slidify`, and
`htmlwidgets`, aimed at simplifying the process of creating interactive
visualizations and web-friendly documents, straight from R.

### 🧑🏻‍🏫 Teaching Approach

My teaching style and curriculum is informed by the following learning
principles:

1.  **Tinkering**: We learn by building. There are demos and pre-written
    code included throughout the course to demonstrate concepts, but
    please play around with them, modify them, and question the results.
2.  **Scaling** from simple to complex: We will start with simple
    models, then increase the complexity with each project/exercise. Our
    goal is to understand the pros and cons of each method and to learn
    which method works best for each project.
3.  **Focus** on fundamentals/concepts and not on tools/language: We
    focus on equipping you with a strong foundation. Concepts and tools
    are both important, but with the tech landscape changing so quickly,
    we want to give you a base on which to build over time.

Please dive right into the course material and projects! They have been
carefully designed to help you internalize the concepts we are learning.
You will learn by doing and applying, and you won’t be in it alone.
Throughout the course, you will be supported by your classmates and our
course team. 🙌

And, in the end, even if you don’t understand everything in one go, it’s
OK! The most important things are to be curious, to help your
classmates, to be brave and ask questions, to persevere when you run
into obstacles, and to have fun.
