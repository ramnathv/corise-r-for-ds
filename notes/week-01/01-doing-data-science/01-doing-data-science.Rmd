## Doing Data Science

### What is Data Science?

Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that involves the use of scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights 
from structured and unstructured data. It involves combining knowledge and techniques from statistics, mathematics, computer science, and domain-specific knowledge to analyze and understand complex phenomena and solve problems.

Data Science encompasses a wide range of activities, including data collection, cleaning, integration, analysis, modeling, and visualization, as well as the communication of findings and insights to stakeholders. It involves the use of various tools, techniques, and technologies, including statistical software, 
machine learning algorithms, data visualization tools, and big data platforms.

Data Science has numerous applications across industries, including finance, healthcare, marketing, social media, and many others. The insights and predictions derived from data analysis can be used to drive business decisions, inform policy, and improve the lives of individuals and communities.


### How to do Data Science?

Learning Data Science is like learning to cook. You start with a set of ingredients and follow a recipe to combine them and transform them into a delicious dish.

While there are several workflows to do data science, the one that has resonated the most with me, and what I have used over time is the one recommended by [Hadley Wickham](https://hadley.nz/).

The first step almost always is to __import__ data. Data comes in different
forms and shapes: files, databases, APIs etc. Before you can start analyzing
data, you need to bring it into the environment you are working with.

Raw data is almost always NEVER clean. Hence, the next step in a typical
data science workflow is to __tidy__ it. Tidying data often involves cleaning


Now that you have clean data, the third step is to __transform__ it. In this
step, you often manipulate individual variables, add new variables, select
observations of interest, aggregate values across specific groups etc.

The real fun starts after you have transformed your data. The next step in the journey is to __visualize__ it. Visualizations let you explore the data and gain insights.

An equally important part of the workflow is to __model__ the data. This involves analyzing hypotheses on the data as well as building predictions.

The __transform__ > __visualize__ > __model__ cycle is usually a highly iterative one and one will find themselves tweaking each step repeatedly till you find the optimal solution.

The last step in the workflow is to __communicate__ the data. This is done by turning your analysis into reports, dashboards, web apps and other artifacts that can be shared across a broad range of stakeholders.

Our focus in this course will largely be on the __transform__ and __visualize__ steps of the workflow. Shown below is a slightly more detailed roadmap of the key topics we will cover in this course.

### Why R & Tidyverse?

<!-- Why R? -->


One of the biggest strengths of R is its extensive ecosystem of __packages__.
An R package is a suite of functions along with data and documentation, that
extends the functionality of base R. 

<!-- Why Tidyverse -->

The Tidyverse is a highly opinionated set of packages that share a common
underlying grammar and philosophy and are designed to work together to execute
the data science workflow.

Rather than talk about the beauty of the `tidyverse`, I want you to experience it for yourself by working through the next lesson that uses the tidyverse to turn a dataset of US baby names into a beautiful animated bar chart.

## R in a Nutshell

### Everything that exists is an object [John Chambers]

The first idea to grasp is that everything in R is an object. The most fundamental type of object in R is a __vector__. You can think about a vector as a collection of elements. Shown below are three different vectors, each of which has been assigned a name. The first object holds characters, the second one holds logicals, the third consists of integers, while the fourth consists of numbers. Overall, R supports SIX different types of vectors: `integer`, `numeric`, `logical`, `character`, `complex`, and `raw`. In this course, we will only worry about the first FOUR!

```{r objects}
baby_names <- c("John", "Marie", "Elizabeth")
baby_is_male <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
baby_nb_births <- c(120L, 30L, 60L)
baby_pct_births <- c(0.04, 0.01, 0.02)
```


Some of you might be wondering that if a vector is a collection of elements, what would one call a single element of a vector? A scalar perhaps? Well, the answer might surprise you. There are NO scalars in R. A single element of a vector is also a vector, albeit of length 1. 

```{r scalar}
baby_name <- "John" 
```


Three comments are in order. 

1. First you might have noticed the strange looking symbol, `<-`. It is the assignment operator in R and used to assign an object to a name. It consists of two symbols, a less-than-or-equal symbol followed by a hyphen, but might appear as a single symbol when you use fonts like Fira Code, which have special ligatures for combination of symbols. 

2. Second, you might have observed that we used an `L` as a suffix for some numbers. The reason for this is that R needs a way to tell apart the integer 120 from the floating point number 120 and adding the suffix provides that precise disambiguation.

3. Third, what about that `c()` used to define these vectors. Is it an object too? Nope! `c()`  is a function that concatenates multiple elements into a single vector. You will learn more about functions in the next section.


### Everything that happens is the result of a function call [John Chambers]

The second core idea in R is that every action is the result of a function call. You already encountered the `c()` function that took in multiple elements and concatenated them into a single vector. The base R language ships with a large range of functions that can perform simple to complex actions. For example, let us suppose you want to generate 1000 random normal variables and plot a histogram. In most other languages,  you will need to write multiple lines of code to accomplish this task. However, in base R, it boils down to two lines of code.
 
```{r function-call}
x <- rnorm(n = 1000)
hist(x)
```


The first line calls the function `rnorm()` to generate a numeric vector of 1000 random normal variables. The second line plots a __histogram__ of these numbers. You can even combine the two lines into a single line!

```{r histogram}
hist(rnorm(n = 1000))
```


### Embrace the Pipe

![pipe](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/8bdd38_24ca8c3b77e84e89ab218bab1d04ecf6~mv2.jpeg/v1/fill/w_640,h_446,al_c,lg_1,q_80,enc_auto/8bdd38_24ca8c3b77e84e89ab218bab1d04ecf6~mv2.jpeg)

Now suppose you are given a vector of US state names, `state.name`, and you want to create a bar plot that shows a frequency distribution of the first letter. How would you go about it? Let us write down the steps first.

1. Extract the first letter from each state.
2. Count the frequency of each letter.
3. Create a bar plot of the frequency counts.

We are almost there! Now we need to figure out how to execute each of these steps. The beauty of R is that it was designed by statisticians to precisely solve data analysis problems and so it ships with functions that can handle (1) - (3).  We will use the `substr()` function to extract the first letter, the `table()` function to tabulate the frequency counts, and the `barplot()`  function to create the bar plot. 


```{r sequential}
# 1. Extract the first letter from each name
first_letters <- substr(state.name, 1, 1)

# 2. Count the frequency of each letter
first_letters_counts <- table(first_letters)

# 3. Create a bar plot of the frequency counts
barplot(first_letters_counts)
```

Running this code will create a nice bar plot.  Note how we just had to know the right functions to use to get the job done!  The multiple lines of code mirror the exact  order of the steps. However, they add a lot of clutter in terms of intermediate objects that have to be named appropriately. As the number of steps increase, you will have to spend more time to understand the code. 

Alternatively, we could have also written this code as a one-liner!

```{r oneline}
barplot(table(substr(state.name, 1, 1)))
```

It skips the step of having to create intermediate variables and naming them appropriately. However, if you were to read the code carefully, you will notice that the steps read in the opposite direction to our recipe. 

1. Create a bar plot (of)
2. A frequency table (of)
3. First letters of state names

Similar to the multi-line code, as  you add more steps to the recipe, this can obfuscate the intent of the code and make it really cumbersome to read. Is there a solution that combines the best of both approaches? The answer is yes

Well, fortunately, R has our backs covered once again. In R 4.1, the language formally introduced the pipe operator `|>`  that lets us rewrite the same code in a more intuitive fashion.

```{r pipe}
state.name |>     # Take baby_names, then
  substr(1, 1) |> # Extract the first letter, then
  table() |>      # Tabulate the frequencies, then
  barplot()       # Create a bar plot.
```

Notice how the steps are now ordered exactly the same way we wrote our recipe, and there is no clutter of intermediate objects. In fact, if the functions were named as verbs, the code would read just like the English language. 

### Embrace Data Structures

While learning any new programming language, it is important to understand the data structures it supports, and how to create, read, update, and delete its elements. R supports a rich set of data structures. 

__Homogeneous__ data structures hold the same type of data (numeric, character, logical etc.). Vectors are the simplest of this kind and are 1-dimensional in nature. Matrices are 2-dimensional and Arrays are multi-dimensional. We won’t be working with matrices and arrays in this course.

```{r data-structures-1}
v <- c(1, 2, 3)
M <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
A <- array(1:24, dim = c(2, 3, 4))
```


__Heterogeneous__ data structures can hold different types of data (numeric, character, logical etc.). Lists are the 1-dimensional equivalent of vectors, and can be used to store a mix of data types. For example, the two lists shown below store the first name, last name and age of a person. While both lists hold the same information, the second list names its constituent elements, which can come very handy when we try to access them.

```{r data-structures-2}
l1 <- list('Jane', 'Austen', 42)
l2 <- list(first_name = 'Jane', last_name = 'Austen', age = 42L)
```


Lists are extremely flexible and can be nested to hold other lists too.

```{r lists}
l1 <- list('Jane', 'Austen', 42)
l2 <- list('Jane', 'Eyre', 52)
l <- list(l1, l2)
```


A __Data Frame__ is a special type of list where each element of the list has the same length. Visually, this resembles a rectangular table, the most ubiquitous data structure found everywhere from excel tables to sql databases. 

```{r data-frames}
D <- data.frame(
  name = c("Mary", "John"),
  sex = c("Female", "Male"),
  year = c(1980, 1980),
  births = c(5490, 9102)
)
D
```

We will mostly work with data frames in this course.

This is a whirlwind introduction to R and summarizes the key ideas you will need for this course. For a more thorough introduction to R, I would strongly recommend the book [Hands On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/index.html). The online version of the book is free to use. In order to use R for Data Science in the long run, you will need to get more familiar with the language.
